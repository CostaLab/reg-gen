ToDo:
- input scaling factor fails sometimes... make it to 1 (?) if this is the case
- bw tools automatically in bin PATH
- strand lag for ODIN?
- TMM for ODIN?

done
- foldchange option is now available, was deprecated for some reasons
- bugfix when no-correction is on: filter by threshold that is given by option and do not output everything

ODIN-0.4
- solve the following question automativally:
	Does your chromosome size file contain the same chromosome information like your BAM file and your genome file, that is, do all these files contain e.g. chr1, chr2, ... or 1, 2, ...?
- fix bug with missing 'chr' prefix in BAM files
- bugfix for --region option
- extension size estimation
- change description of the option --region
- to not throw out uncorrected p-values

* ODIN-0.3.2
- mac support
- bug: input dna chrom does not overlap with chrom in IP, no longer an error

* ODIN-0.3.1
- use HMMs of hmmlearn instead of sklearn

* ODIN-0.3
- fix estimate shiftsize if seq in bam file not given
- cite function
- increase threshold for pvalue calculation
- p-value correction
- output directory as option
- nicer *-setup.info output

* ODIN-0.2
- get rid of option for different normalization strategies
- add more infos to options
- merge DPs in output
- rename output signal expname - bam name - normalized.bw
- remove p-values that are too high (pvalue cutoff bug)
- describe 'm' option on HP, emphasize it in the help
- give out narrowPeak
- add debug and verbose flag
- more infos in setup.info (read extension, normalization factor)
- bugfix: coordinate shift of peaks

* ODIN-0.1.1
- fix chrom size bug (take several genomes now)
- fix bigWigConstruction bug (add new flag)
- check whether wigToBigWig is in $PATH variable, and give warning if not

* ODIN-0.1alpha
