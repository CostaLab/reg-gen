* ODIN-0.1.2
- get rid of option for different normalization strategies
- add more infos to options
- merge DPs in output

TODO
- we should save all relevant statistics in the .info file. Read
extension size, normalization factor (and anything else we should
think of).

- i think the name of the bw files should be the same as the original
name of the bam file (plus a string "normalized").

- right now all the peaks have 1000 bps, although the default windows
size is 100. Why is that?


- consider p-value bug (done)

- add debug and verbose flag
- give out narrowPeak

- describe 'm' option on HP, emphasize it in the help (done)

* ODIN-0.1.1
- fix chrom size bug (take several genomes now)
- fix bigWigConstruction bug (add new flag)
- check whether wigToBigWig is in $PATH variable, and give warning if not

* ODIN-0.1alpha
