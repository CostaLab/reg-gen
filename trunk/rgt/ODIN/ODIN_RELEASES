* ODIN-0.1.2
- get rid of option for different normalization strategies
- add more infos to options

TODO
- we should save all relevant statistics in the .info file. Read
extension size, normalization factor (and anything else we should
think of).

- i think the name of the bw files should be the same as the original
name of the bam file (plus a string "normalized").

- right now all the peaks have 1000 bps, although the default windows
size is 100. Why is that?

- I also missed that we should use -m for histones. We should state
this explicitly in the example state (or include a more detailed
tutorial with histones as well). Maybe we should put the description
of this important parameters after the p-value, so that users don't
miss this.

- consider p-value bug
- add debug and verbose flag
- give out narrowPeak
- for extra tools: use bash!
- describe 'm' option in HP

* ODIN-0.1.1
- fix chrom size bug (take several genomes now)
- fix bigWigConstruction bug (add new flag)
- check whether wigToBigWig is in $PATH variable, and give warning if not

* ODIN-0.1alpha
