=========== Part 1 ===========
bigwig -> coverageSet (one file) multiCoverageSet
parallel I/O, improving read speed, reading from web!

bigbed -> GenomicRegionSet (currently only bed can be read not bigbed)
bigbed have different variants

profiling

Files: CoverageSet

=========== Part 2 ===========
GenomicRegionSet
Jaccard-Test, Intersection Test, Motif Analysis -> all slow
start profiling
Jaccard: One vs. many random
compare with bedtools
cython
gprofiler to profile python for time
use example from last week for Jaccard test

Files: GenomicRegionSet
