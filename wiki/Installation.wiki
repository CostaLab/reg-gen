= Installation =

You can install the package by typing:
{{{
cd <package_folder>
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

If you don't have superuser permissions, you can the prefix scheme to install the package to a folder in which you have access to:
{{{
python setup.py install --prefix=<install_folder>
}}}

= Customized Installation =

During the usual installation, a folder named `rgtdata` will be created in your home directory. This folder contains auxiliary data such as the sizes of the chromosomes and gene annotations needed by all tools. You can define a new location `data_folder` by adding:
{{{
--rgt-data-path=<data_folder>
}}}
to your installation command.

This folder contains a file named `data.config` which will define the default auxiliary data that will be used. Also, default auxiliary data will be provided for some selected organisms.
