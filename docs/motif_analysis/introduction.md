# Introduction

## Method
We provide a flexible framework to perform operations related to motif analyses. Currently, the following analyses are available:
Motif Matching: Matches a set of transcription factor motifs found on the main repositories (such as [Jaspar](http://jaspar.genereg.net/), [Uniprobe](http://the_brain.bwh.harvard.edu/uniprobe/) and [Hocomoco](http://autosome.ru/HOCOMOCO/)) against a set of genomic regions of interest.
Motif Enrichment: Performs Fisherâ€™s exact test in order to verify if a set of genomic regions are enriched for particular transcription factors.
